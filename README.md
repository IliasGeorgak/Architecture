#This is a processor designed in VHDL and run in Xilinx ISE
##All necesssary test benches and coe files for the ROM memory are included with project.
##In order to simulate you will need either Xilinx or Vivado ISE (other tools could also do the job but have not been tested) 
##The instruction set given for this project is called CHARIS and is very closely related to MIPS. It was provided by the professor as a part of the Computer Architecture course.
